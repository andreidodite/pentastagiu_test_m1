Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)
V-Model is like a mirror  way of developing because you make things in parallel 
Agile is when you make increments with small steps and professional people that can manage themselves in order to create an increment which is working and brings value to the customer. He can put in prod earlier and gain money from his product.
